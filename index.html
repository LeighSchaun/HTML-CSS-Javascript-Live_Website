            <h2 id="b1_verse">Leviticus 27:30
              'A tithe of everything from the land, whether grain from the soil or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD; it is holy to the LORD.
              </h2>
              <br>
            <p>We are all gifted with seeds(talents; dreams; and visions).
              We have a cleaner; administrator; and IT manager. Each one earns a different income bracket.
              If each one gives 10% of what they earn to the next person who is unable to bear fruit (disabled; sick; or elderly).
              That way - we honor the true gift of tithing. 
              Tithing isn’t about 10% of your earnings. It could be sharing wisdom so that one could learn how to fish themselves. 
              We need to determine which 10% we plan to share and when we share it. We do it with great love expecting nothing in return.
              It's important to love your neighbor as you love yourself. If you are not willing to eat out of a bin. Then don’t watch the next one do it.
              Once you focus on your seed. Employ 5% of your earnings to someone to clean your place. 5% of your earnings go to someone to maintain your garden. If you don’t have a garden. Pay 10% to someone to clean your place. 
              To be fruitful; it's to allow the seeds you are planting to grow and be fruitful as well.

            <h2 id="b1_verse">We have human life; animal life; and plant life</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Plant life was the first form of life. Plant life provides oxygen which is the form/basic core of life.
              Animal life came after plant life. Animals could eat fruits and grass to maintain their animal life.
              Human life was the last form of life. Humans consume fruits and vegetables from plant life, and meat from animal life.
              Humans were made to move.
              If you are a human; you’re not a tree. You can move. 
              Humans were given a free mind of choice.
              If you are a human; you don’t eat other humans. You eat the meat of an animal. You are not owned by an animal.
              Humans are made to learn from plant and animal life. God has gifted us with wisdom through plants and animals. 
              Once we show love to plants and animals; we show love to life – human life.

            <h2 id="b1_verse">God is the father. Wisdom of God is the mother.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Mothers were made to show more love to their children. 
              We are God’s children. God wants us to have wisdom. His wisdom provides us with truth and light. In the bible you can find Wisdom in the book of Proverbs.
              To be a male you need to give life(seed) to a woman. 
              To be a female you need to produce life.
              If you are unable to produce life. You are a male. 
              If you unable to give life. You are a female.
              Males are born to create foundations for females to produce life. To work the fields so that the female can feed him and their produced life/s. Males are protectors in the field.
              If a female needs to work the fields or become a protector. It should only be under the circumstances that the male is unable to fulfill his duty. 
              Females were not born to be dominant. Females were born to guide Males with wisdom and direction.
              You give a female a house; she gives you a home.
              You give a female a seed; she produces life.

            <p>God will use your weaknesses for your purpose and your strengths to direct you into purpose.
              If you abuse your seed. You will die.
              Slow death is a process that happens over time, and you don’t want to reduce your life by abusing your seed. 
              How many days do you have left on earth? Its through wisdom we understand that each day; we are contributing towards our life. 
              Your seed is to be fruitful. Whatever it is that you are fruitful in. You need to make sure that your seeds you are sowing in; are also fruitful.
              Self-worth is knowing that greater is he that is in you; than he that is in the world (obstacles; challenges; and trails).
              You are worthy of great things because you were promised to be a head and not the tail.
              You need to know your place in the jungle of life. Its either you are the head of ants in the jungle; the head of elephants in the jungle; or the head of lions.

        <h1 class="section-title">About <span>ONE G</span></h1>
        <h2>Entering the Kingdom of GOD</h2>
        <p>Who is one G?
          One G is God - our ‘father’ of life who has given us a gift called ‘life’. In this life we have one goal and that is to find ‘purpose’. To find purpose – you need to continually seek; knock; and ask. In time, you will find your answers through ways which are not always they way you expected to be answered. One G is a man who has been marked with a scar(one) to represent one God. Its about sharing his relationship with you on wisdom, knowledge, and understanding to be fruitful in your own life.
          Why one G?
          He believes in the wisdom of God that the path to a fruitful life is narrow and those who find it; finds life; and life in abundance. So, he created this platform to write his story in the main book of many books of witnesses who shared their stories and testimonies of God. We all have testimonies, and we should seek to spread love with those testimonies. 
          How to understand one G?
          LOVE. Love is God and God is love. Love is a spirit that we were gifted with freely. We should use Love to our advantage. Now through this journey you will learn about Love(God) and it will feel difficult, but remember. Tough love is still love and that we understand the different realms of love we have within us. So how to understand one G – is to Love God and yourself.</p>
